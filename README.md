This was for a Guided-Project on Coursera called 'Analyze Network Traffic with TCPDump' https://www.coursera.org/projects/analyze-network-traffic-with-tcpdump

The command is meant to capture all TCP traffic on port 22, the default port for Secure Shell (SSH). The -i any option specifies that the traffic should be captured from all interfaces. 
The -#XXtttt option specifies # adds a line number to each packet, XX hexadecimal format, and tttt timed packets and -w output should be saved to a file named proof.pcap. 
The -G 600 option specifies that the capture should be stopped after 600 seconds (10 minutes). 
In summary, the command will capture all TCP traffic on port 22 for 10 minutes and save to a file named proof.pcap in hexadecimal format.
